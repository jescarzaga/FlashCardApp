This is a flash card app I created that has the around 500 common Japanese words on one side with the English translation on the other side.
After a 3 second timer the card flips over and shows the English translation.
This takes in a csv file, currently there is a Japanese and French one, but only the Japanese one is used.
There are two buttons one for if you know the word and another for if you don't. As of now the button only goes to another word at random, but once I learn more words I'll make it so that the buttons either keep or remove the word from the dictionary.
The tkinter class is used to create the window and the UI.
